DynamicTreeView builds to the DynamicTreeView library, and DynamicTreeViewExample offers a simple demo

A DynamicTreeView consists of a collection of DynamicTreeViewNodes, 
which optionally can be forcibly parented to a root node (useful 
for tying data to the underyling model).

See IDynamicTreeNodeDataProxy for more configurable individual node behavior.
